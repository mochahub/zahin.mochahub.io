        At BitGo I worked in the portfolio team, assisting in migrating the acquired app Lumina into the BitGo stack and ecosystem for a unified experience both from the UI/UX and from the backend data model perspective. 
        I worked closely with developers across different teams and tech stacks to create the project timeline, technical design documents, and code to migrate users.
        During my internship I was in charge of this project as my quarterly goal along with assisting in the daily bug fixes/fires, and have led it to completion. 
        The most challenging aspect of this migration was making it backwards compatible for clients that have chosen to not migrate to the new experience while minimizing the number of code paths present in the system.

At Lumina I assisted with implementing new cryptocurrency exchanges / blockchain explorers into the product. An integration included being able to scrape all of a users transaction history, a users account details and lastly the instruments supported along with their historical prices.
        \nSome of the more interesting integrations where exchanges that held derivative instruments such as perpetual futures options, staking coins, and borrowed coins as they all provided their own interesting impact on a users realized gains (for tax purposes).   
        \nA project that I led to completion was the integration of all Compound tokens and the infrastructure to retrieve their historical price. The integration was publicized [here](https://medium.com/luminaapp/compound-now-available-on-lumina-introducing-defi-accounting-tax-6b174c3b809d).

The purpose of the game was to analyze a child's response before and after the game. The game simulated an online opponent, and would win or lose dependant on the game parameters set by the researchers before hand. The game collected analytics data such as how fast the child played, and text and audio that they wanted to convey to their opponent.
